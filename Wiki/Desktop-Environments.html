            <h2 class="H">Desktop environment comparisons... are kinda bad.</h2>
            <div class="Divider"></div>
            <p class="para">If that doesn't make sense, go look one up. Yeah, they are all conflicting. And that's totally fine, everyone has their own opinion and all, and this is mine, but some of them have bias towards some environments. That's obviously not saying that I don't have any bias, but do take this whole thing with a grain of salt.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="H">Wait, what in the world are you talking about?</h2>
            <div class="Divider"></div>
            <p class="para">Okay, let's break this down. When you use any Linux system with a desktop, you are using a Desktop Environment. This essentially is the thing that gives you something to look at, other than just a terminal. These environments also give you some programs to use, ranging from things like web browsers to things like app browsers.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="para"><strong>Do note that you can freely install programs from other Desktop environments, they just might have some problems.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="H">Wait, if the apps can have problems, are there any other things to watch out for?</h2>
            <div class="Divider"></div>
            <p class="para">Actually, yes. Mixing Desktop Environments can be very risky, for one. Sometimes they might break your entire system if you do it wrong. Sometimes they might be totally fine. There are actual ways to make it work, and I will list it later, but for now we're focusing on the list.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="para"><strong>If you pick a distro, or a premade Linux setup, chances are it comes with it's own DE</strong></p>

        </div>
        <div class="List">
        <h1 class="H">The List (finally)</h2>
        <p class="para">Obviously I can't exactly list a pros and cons, as most of these have the exact same functionality with some configuration, but I can list features and any problems I have had with the one's I've used. Trust me when I say I have had problems with all of them.</p>

                       <li>Entirely unique starting configuration (Doesn't resemble Windows or MacOS)</li>
                       <li>Good looking everything. From the "taskbar" to the App Drawer, it all looks good</li>
                       <li>Latest version is decently lightweight (Used to be heavy compared to others) (~3.1GB Installed)</li>
                       <li>Absolutely huge community</li>
                       <li>Wayland Support</li>

                   <ul class="Cons">
                      <li>It's laggy. Opening the App Drawer is very slow on every computer I've used.</li>
                      <li>It being unique makes it hard to get used to at first</li>
                      <li>Software Center can be very slow, or simply missing things</li>
