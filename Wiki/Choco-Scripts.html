            <p class="para">As I don't have Microsoft OneDrive setup, as it is the reason my computer sometimes stops working entirely, I do not have backups of any files or anything, other than stuff like this GitHub repository, or Google Cloud or something.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="P2">
                <p class="para"><code>discord</code>: Social Media platform that I personally don't enjoy using, but am essentially forced to use it due to everyone I know using it.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>firefox</code>: The best browser in my eyes. No it's not the most private of browsers, but it's not built on Chromium, which is the main benefit. Chromium is awful and if you don't know why, go ahead and keep using it.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>steam-client</code>: Steam. The best video game launcher ever. Period.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>zerotier-one</code>: There's another page in the wiki for this.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>epicgameslauncher</code>: Epic Games Launcher. Maybe the second best video games launcher?</p>
                <p class="para"><code>battle.net</code>: Owned by Blizzard. Anything Blizzard is probably on here.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>ubisoft-connect</code>: Ubisoft Connect. Maybe the most hated video game launcher to many, not by me. I generally enjoy using it.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>putty</code>: Actually called PuTTY. It's an entirely free SSH client with a perfect UI for my uses.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>winscp</code>: WinSCP is a SFTP client. Similar to PuTTY, but instead of a remote terminal, it's a remote file manager.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>treesizefree</code>: The free version of a disk space manager. Everyone I know has one they like, this is mine.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>peazip</code>: A utility to do all kinds of things with all kinds of codecs that the default file manager doesn't do. I prefer it over 7zip or WinRar personally.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>reaper</code>: A DAW that I use to add filters and boost my microphone. I have yet to find a microphone setup on Windows that picks up my voice properly, so I have to boost the hell out of my mic. I paid for the license so I didn't have to wait the 5 seconds.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>mpc-hc</code>: Media Player Classic Home Cinema edition. I prefer it over VLC Media Player, and both are significantly better than the built-in Media Player.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>k-litecodecpackfull</code>: K-Lite Codec Pack full version. You could probably just download the Standard version, but I have yet to see or use a codec that full doesn't support.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>cpu-z</code>: CPU monitoring software. Simple as that. Only used for checking very specific things.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>gpu-z</code>: Same as Cpu-z, but for Graphics Cards.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>parsec</code>: Software for remote accessing a desktop. Instead of a terminal, or a file manager, this lets me use someone's computer from across the country for various reasons.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>dotnetcore-desktopruntime</code>: Microsoft .NET Core Desktop Runtime. This is used for so many things, mainly for <a href="https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows">Ryochan7's DS4Windows</a>.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>vcredist-all</code>: Downloads all Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime versions. Saves me from having to go to the Microsoft website, just like the .NET Runtime.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>tidal</code>: Tidal is basically Spotify, with less songs but significantly higher sound quality.</p>
                <p class="para"><code>roccatswarm</code>: Roccat Swarm is Roccat's software for controlling</p>
                <p class="para"><code>-y</code>: skips chocolatey asking if I really want to download this stuff.</p>
                <p class="para">If you need different packages than the ones I listed here, go to this <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages">this website</a>. That is the chocolatey package list website, so anything you might need, just type the name into the search bar and it might be there.</p>

                <p class="para">Yeah, some software is definitely missing here.</p>
                <p class="para">The reason for that is that not everything that I use has a chocolatey script.</p>
                <p class="para">Some things still need downloading from the specific websites, or I prefer to download from the website directly.</p>
