            <div class="Divider"></div>
            <div class="P1">
                <p class="para">You know when you pay for a subscription for any service and it automatically sets itself up to renew? I hate that.</p>
                <p class="para">As an example, if you pay for Xbox Game Pass, after a little bit of not having it, the price goes down to $1 USD. If you forget to turn off recurring billing however, (which by the way requires you to visit the website, log in, go to manage subscriptions, and then turn it off) after a month of not thinking about it you suddenly get charged $14.99.</p>
                <p class="para">The price however, is not my issue. There are times when I cannot afford to spend $15 that month, and since the subscription lasts a month, I usually forget about it in that time.</p>

            <h2 class="H">Nvidia's behaviour is extremely disappointing...</h2>
            <div class="Divider"></div>
            <div class="P1">
                <p class="para">In case you don't know what I'm talking about (or you're reading this after they fixed their attitude), Nvidia has been charging more and more for increasingly disappointing products.</p>
                <p class="para">More recently, however, they intended to release 2 versions of the 4080. The 4080 12GB, and 16GB. The 4080 12GB was supposed to be released at $800, right up until AMD released the 7900 XTX for nearly the same price.</p>
                <p class="para">The 7900 XTX absolutely massacred the poor 4080 16GB for cheaper, and nearly broke even with the 4090 given some overclocking, but again, at $600 cheaper. This showed some <i><strong>really bad</strong></i> news for the 4080 12GB.</p>
                <p class="para">If the 16GB card couldn't beat it, what chance did the 12GB have? Absolutely none is the answer. So what was Nvidia's answer? "Ehh keep going with it." (Paraphrasing but you know what I mean)</p>
                <p class="para">The only thing that made them save their own faces, was media and customers basically yelling at Nvidia to not release the 12GB like that. They eventually released it as the 4070 Ti, but what does it matter when the 7900 XT handily beat it at the same price.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="para">They have kept up with this behaviour for some time now, and I think now is when it really showed. Have I also mentioned how power hungry the 4090 is? It consumes 400W+ Max, and is a quad slot card for the heat it gives off. The 7900 XTX, on the other hand, is a dual slot card (2.5 slots IMO). </p>
