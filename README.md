# The "Hub"
This is a type of "hub" where, hopefully, in the future I will take a look at all kinds of things, and (hopefully) make some helpful guides or something about them.
This can range from things like my thoughts about games, software comparisons, to even things like hardware comparison.
If you're here, you probably know me on Discord or something.
As I am definitely not a programmer or anything close to the sort, take some of my examinations with a grain of salt.
I am examining these as essentially a "curious end-user" who knows enough about certain things to learn how to fix them incase they break, and with enough time on my hands to thoroughly look into something.

### I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO TO THE WIKI OR [THE WEBSITE](https://defnotapenguin.github.io/The-Hub-/), I UPDATE BOTH FAR MORE OFTEN THAN THE REPO
