# Alternative-Softwares
This is a type of "hub" where, hopefully, in the future I will take a look at alternatives to popular softwares, examine them, compare them to each other, and make guides about them.
This is mainly for people that don't particularly like certain softwares and want to find good alternatives for them.
As I am definitely not a programmer or anything close to the sort, take some of my examinations with a grain of salt.
I am examining these as essentially a "curious end-user" who knows enough about certain things to learn how to fix them incase they break, and with enough time on my hands to thoroughly look into something.
